We need to convert the original HTML content into markdown.
Remember that, in markdown, ALL mathematical notation must be wrapped in 
$ ... $ for inline math or $$ ... $$ for display mode, where '...' 
is a LaTeX expression.

Please remove any unnecessary structural markup, leave just the pertinent content.
There should not be any remaining HTML syntax in your output.

Your response should begin with the reformatted content directly, no additional prose.
