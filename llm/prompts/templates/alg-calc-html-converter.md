We need to convert the original HTML content into markdown.
Note that markdown images use the `[name](link)` syntax.
Also remember that you MUST wrap all mathematical LaTeX notation in markdown with either:
- $$ ... $$ for inline math, or
- $$$$ ... $$$$ for display math
where '...' is a LaTeX expression. Do not use other environments like `\begin{...}`, just stick to the $$ notation.


Please remove any unnecessary structural markup, leave just the pertinent content.
There should not be any remaining HTML syntax in your output.

Your response should begin with the reformatted content directly, no additional prose.
